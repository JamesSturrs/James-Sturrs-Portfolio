Uni project to code a Tamagotchi style pet sim with C++ in visual studio. 


This was also supposed to include an unreal version but due to my laptop almost literally bursting into flames, unreal is currently unavailable to me so until I get new parts in to stop it from melting
through my lap, this is the best I can do for now unfortunately. Nothing I can do about it.
